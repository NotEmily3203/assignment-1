            <p>
                Snakes are elongated, limbless reptiles belonging to the suborder Serpentes. 
                They are found on every continent except Antarctica and vary greatly in size, 
                color, and habitat. Snakes have flexible bodies covered in scales, and they 
                use a combination of muscle contractions and scale friction to move. Most snakes 
                are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of prey including rodents, birds, insects, 
                and other reptiles. They use a specialized jaw structure to swallow prey whole. 
                While some snakes are venomous and use venom to immobilize or kill their prey, 
                many species are non-venomous and rely on constriction to subdue their victims. 
                Snakes play important roles in ecosystems as both predators and prey, and they 
                have been the subject of fascination and fear throughout human history.</p>
