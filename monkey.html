            <h1>Monkey</h1>
            <p>
                Monkeys, belonging to the primate order, are diverse mammals found 
                in habitats worldwide, ranging from tropical rainforests to savannas. 
                Exhibiting varied sizes and appearances, from the tiny pygmy marmoset 
                to the impressive gorilla, they are known for their dexterous hands, 
                forward-facing eyes, and complex social behaviors. Omnivorous in diet, 
                monkeys consume fruits, leaves, insects, and occasionally small mammals 
                or eggs, showcasing their adaptability. Across species, they exhibit 
                unique adaptations; some, like capuchin monkeys, are skilled tool users, 
                while others, like howler monkeys, are recognized for their resonant 
                vocalizations. Despite their versatility, monkeys face threats including 
                habitat loss, deforestation, hunting, and the illegal pet trade, 
                highlighting the need for conservation efforts to ensure their survival 
                in the wild.</p>
