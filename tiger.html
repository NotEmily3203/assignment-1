            <h1>Tiger</h1>
            <p>
                A tiger is a large carnivorous mammal belonging to the Felidae family and 
                Panthera genus. Known for its distinctive orange fur with black stripes, 
                the tiger is one of the most recognizable and iconic big cats in the world. 
                Tigers have muscular bodies with powerful limbs, allowing them to be agile 
                hunters and formidable predators in their natural habitats. They possess keen 
                senses, including excellent vision and hearing, which aid them in stalking 
                and ambushing prey. Tigers are solitary animals, typically only coming 
                together for mating purposes. They are apex predators, playing a crucial 
                role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems they inhabit. Unfortunately, 
                due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, many tiger species 
                are endangered, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to ensure 
                their survival in the wild.</p>
